== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why am I redirected to your website for creating a shortcode? =
Some people find it hard to construct a shortcode by hand, that's why we created a tool te make it more convenient.

= How does it work with WooCommerce? =
You need to have images in your gallery and you need the shortcode filled into the product properties.
Then the viewer will be shown in the product gallery. You can also use the shortcode in combination with a Gutenberg lock or Elementor block. In that case you must set the block to use the WooCommerce product code for presentation.

= How does it work with Advanced Custom Fields? =
In the settings there is an options to define the ACF field what must be used by the Gutenberg block or Elementor block. In that case you must set the block to use the ACF code for presentation. You can fill the ACF field with the shortcode and it will be used by the block.

= Can I use global settings? =
Yes, you can use global settings in the settings page. You can also use the shortcode to override the global settings.

= Can I use it in my templates? =
Yes, you can call parse_jsv360_shortcode() function within your template. Use the shortcode as a parameter.
